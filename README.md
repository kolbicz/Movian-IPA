Pre-compiled Movian for iOS
===========================

I compiled the source code of Movian from https://github.com/andoma/movian for iOS, since the beta version has expired and no pre-compiled binaries were released.

Changes:
========
- updated freetype to version 2.9.1
- updated libpng to version 1.6.36

General Information:
====================
- tested on iOS 10.2 (ipad) and iOS 11.3.1 (iphone)
- minimum iOS version is 10.0, compiled for arm64 only
- .ipa needs to be signed with a dev cert or using cydia impactor (http://www.cydiaimpactor.com)
- on a jailbroken iOS, you can use ReProvision to resign it automaticly (when using the free dev account)

Full credits go to Andoma - the creator of Movian. I did not add or change any functionality in Movian.
